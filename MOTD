Yo beta testers, this is the message of the day board (Updates without game update)

if your game loads in a void and you can see a chair with Timmy hovering over it means I made the game unplayable till next update

Enjoy also I realise the game outside of the horror mode is laggy so I will aim at fixing that next update
